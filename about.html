<h2>The Story So Far</h2>
<p>2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ of Nazareth started a movement that has
revolutionised human history. It was, and is, a movement that centred upon
who He claimed to be - God’s Son - and what He claimed to accomplish
through His death and resurrection - complete forgiveness and the hope of
eternal life for all who would trust in Him.
We are part of that movement.
  </p>

<p>When Jesus wanted to describe how this movement would grow to His
closest friends, He used a picture …
<em>“It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground,
is the smallest of all the seeds on earth, yet when it is sown it grows
up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large
branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its
shade.</em>
" (Mark 4:31-32)</p>
<p>Back in the Summer of 2010, inspired by this picture, Owen and Charlotte
began to dream about planting the good news of Jesus in the South of
Cardiff, and watching it become a vibrant Church community - a place
where people would meet Jesus for themselves, become part of His family
and find shelter in His grace. Over the past 7 years this dream has grown in
clarity and intensity, and so in early 2017 shared it with their Church in North
Cardiff and gathered a group of like-minded people to join them on the
adventure of starting this new Church for the South of the city.</p>
<p>We have now begun to gather weekly in 
<strong>Grangetown</strong>
to worship Jesus and live our lives as an authentic and diverse family of faith.
Why not join us!? Whoever you are and whatever your background we
would love to welcome you!</p>

<h2>Why “Grace Church Cardiff”?</h2>

<!-- Potentially this could be represented as a 3x2 table, with logos representing the 3 concepts - grace, church and cardiff - behind the three titles
may require some more logo design. idea so far is grace=fish, church=cross and cardiff=dragon. --> 
<table class='table' id='aboutTable' style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>grace</th>
		<th>church</th>
		<th>cardiff</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		   A word that is misused as often as it is misunderstood. “Grace” as
       the bible understands is not a tame concept - it is the relentless and loving
       pursuit of God for those who are unworthy and undeserving of His kindness.
         <em>“God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for
         us.”</em> 
	 			(Romans 5:8).
		</td>
	  <td>
		The church is the community of people who have encountered and
			are being changed by the grace of God. We gather to enjoy God’s grace and we
			scatter to extend God’s grace to the world around us.
		</td>	
		<td>
		We are passionate about our city, and particularly the 
			communities in the South of Cardiff. We want to be a church who reflect the
			diversity and creativity of this wonderful part of the city we live in. We are
			also deeply committed to playing our part in seeing this part of the city
			flourish and thrive socially as well as spiritually.

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are a group of ordinary people from different backgrounds who have all
been transformed by discovering the grace of God in Jesus Christ. We still
falter and fail in many ways, but are deeply convinced that the good news of
God’s undeserved love defines us more than our many mistakes.
